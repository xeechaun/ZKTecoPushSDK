<p>ZKTeco Push Protocol SDK (ADMS / Cloud feature) for Biometric Devices Management</p>

  <p>This is the ONLY complete implementation of ZKTeco PUSH/ADMS protocol that can be integrated with any existing solutions.</p>

  <p>Contact us for pricing structure.</p>
<p>https://aurasofts.com/zkteco-fingerprint-attendance/</p>

Our solution is built as a web API that can be hosted on a Windows or Linux server (Local or Cloud).
Configure the hosted serverâ€™s IP/Port in the ZKTeco devices. Then devices will start communicating the server.

We can receive the attendance logs, user data and fingerprint/face data onto the server. Data will be saved in the DB.

We can delete users from the device(s), send users and fingerprint/face from DB to devices etc.
Our API exposes these functions for invoking those Delete/Copy operations on devices. You can call these API functions from any other software for integration purpose.

We provide the API documentation, sample Postman collection, DB structure etc.
We also provide support for deployment.
