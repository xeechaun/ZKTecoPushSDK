<p>ZKTeco Push Protocol SDK (ADMS / Cloud feature) for Biometric Devices Management</p>

<p>This is the ONLY complete implementation of ZKTeco PUSH/ADMS protocol that can be integrated with any existing solutions.</p>

<p>Our solution is built as a web API that can be hosted on a Windows or Linux server (Local or Cloud).</p>
<p>Configure the hosted server's IP/Port in the ZKTeco devices. Then devices will start communicating the server.</p>

<p>We can receive the attendance logs, user data and fingerprint/face data onto the server. Data will be saved in the DB.</p>

<p>We can delete users from the device(s), send users and fingerprint/face from DB to devices etc.</p>
<p>Our API exposes these functions for invoking those Delete/Copy operations on devices. You can call these API functions from any other software for integration purpose.</p>

<p>We provide the API documentation, sample Postman collection, DB structure etc.</p>
<p>We also provide support for deployment.</p>
